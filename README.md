## User Guide

The entirety of my application is contained in a Jupyter Notebook. The projectâ€™s GitHub repo has the notebook file wine_quality_prediction_model.ipynb as well as a requirements.txt file to install any dependencies.

If you are comfortable creating a virtual environment and installing the necessary packages (use: pip install -r requirements.txt), then you can download those two files and open the notebook in your browser or IDE.

**However, the easiest method is to view and run the notebook online with Google Colabs:**
1.	Open the notebook link in your web browser: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F97HQMLrA9mVenBcP9q72gtFarEon_2P?usp=sharing
2.	If you are not already, sign into a Google account. You can only run the code blocks if you are signed in.
3.	Now you can interact with the notebook exactly as you would with Jupyter:

      a. Shift + Enter: Runs the current cell and selects the cell below it

      b. You can run all cells by clicking Runtime > Run all in the top toolbar.

*Note: If you want to run individual cells, you will have to run them sequentially the first time. Variables and functions defined in one cell may be referenced in a later cell.*
